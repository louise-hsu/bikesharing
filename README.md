# bikesharing

## Project Overview 
the goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We'll also want to include information about both New York City and Des Moinesâ€”after all, the investors will need to understand how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to our proposal.

This module has taught me the following:

1. Tableau Basics 
2. Tableau Worksheets
3. Tableau Dashboards 


        
## Documents

Please note: I found that merging data in tableu to be difficult, therefore I merged and created data tables in jupyter notebok and exported it as csv files. I then used the csv files in tableu.

# Module 14 Challenge 

## Challenge overview

1. Pick question: What is the density of McDonald's in New York City versus Des Moines? Does this affect where people go in the city? If so, how?
2. Execute independent research
3. Create Tableu story
4. Create a written analysis

.## WRITTEN ANALYSIS
*** view the story to see my analysis

Des Moines has significantly lower Population than NYC (NYC is almost 40x larger) with a population that is much more spread out. When purely looking at the population that lives in each, one can see that Des Moines also has significantly less people per McDonalds. Inital look at data would indicate that it may not be a worthwhile enterprise to build a Bike Sharing business base on number of inhabitants in Des Moines.

 With the visitor information taken into account, NYC is now only 4-5x the size of Des Moines. Additionally, the population density of the cities begin to converge with NYC at 234k per sq mile and Des Moines at 168k per sq mile. The population vs Mcdonalds density is still rather far apart thought has also converged a bit.
 
 When viewing the locations of the start and stop for the bike shares in NYC against the locations for the Mcdonalds, we find that the data is somewhat correlated, especially in the New York City boroughs east of the Hudson River. However, given this weak correlation, it is probably an overstatement if we were to say Bike Sharing routes are correlated to locations of Mcdonalds. This data also does not prove out causation and more information would be needed to make that assertion.
 
 Given that the number of McDonalds is weakly correlated, the only viable way to make a recommendation based on this data is the population density taking into account both the resident population and visitor population. Given that the population density between the two (after adding visitors) are very similar, a bike sharing program should be something the company explores in Des Moines. However, before such a recommendation could be made, theres are several additional analysis that need to be conducted:

- Miles of bikeable paths in Des Moines vs NYC
- Distance & average travel time between major tourist landmarks in Des Moines (by car vs by bike)
- Seasonality of visitors in Des Moines vs NYC
- Potential Revenue vs Expenses of operating a bike sharing business in Des Moines
